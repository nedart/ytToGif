# ytToGif.sh

A shell script that McGyvers together a number of linux applications to easily turn any Youtube video in an animated GIF. It provides options for start time, duration, crop dimensions, output size, quality and framerate.

I made this after being dissatisfied with the GIF-making options out there; every online utility lacked at least one thing in the above list, and software for creating and editing GIFs is almost non-existent.

# Installation

Install the following dependencies (Debian), then just run the script:
```
sudo apt-get install xterm ffmpeg imagemagick zenity geeqie youtube-dl
```

# License

Use and modify this script however you want, just provide credit if you redistribute.
